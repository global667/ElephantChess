= SPEC-001: XiangQi GUI Design
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The development of a XiangQi (Chinese Chess) GUI is motivated by a desire to cater to a diverse audience with interests in entertainment, online competition, and AI research. This project aims to create an engaging and versatile platform that serves beginners looking to learn and enjoy the game, advanced players seeking competitive play, and researchers focusing on AI development in board game strategy. By leveraging the capabilities of Qt6 and C++, the project will deliver a high-performance, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface that supports game mechanics specific to XiangQi while enabling online gameplay and AI integration.

== Requirements

.MUST Have
* A visually appealing GUI that accurately represents a XiangQi board and pieces, supporting high DPI displays.
* Support for two players to play on a single machine.
* Network play capabilities, allowing players to compete online.
* AI integration, enabling users to play against computer-controlled opponents with varying difficulty levels.
* User profiles and statistics tracking for online competition.
* Redo and Undo functionalities for board navigation, allowing players to review and rethink their moves.

.SHOULD Have
* Tutorial or learning mode for beginners, with tips and move suggestions.
* Replay and save game functionalities for reviewing games and strategies.
* Customizable game settings, including time controls and piece styles.

.COULD Have
* A ranking system for online competition.
* Support for third-party AI integration, facilitating AI research and development.
* Multilingual support to cater to a global audience.

.WON'T Have (at least for the MVP)
* A mobile version of the application.
* Voice chat functionality for online games.

== Method

The application will follow an MVC architecture, leveraging Qt6 for its robust set of libraries for both the front-end GUI and back-end logic. The game logic will enforce XiangQi rules, support undo/redo actions, and include AI opponents with scalable difficulty. Networking capabilities will enable online play. Detailed component diagrams and algorithms for critical functionalities like move validation and AI decision-making will be included, utilizing UML and PlantUML for visual representation.

== Implementation

The development process is organized into phases, starting with environment setup, MVC architecture implementation, game logic and GUI development, networking for online play, AI integration, and concluding with extensive testing and deployment. Each phase is designed to incrementally build towards a fully functional application, with testing and user feedback integrated throughout the process to ensure quality and user satisfaction.

== Milestones

1. Project Setup Complete
2. Core Gameplay Functional
3. Networking Implemented
4. AI Opponent Ready
5. Beta Release
6. Launch

== Gathering Results

Post-launch, the project will collect user feedback and performance metrics to evaluate the application's success in meeting its objectives and to inform future development efforts. Continuous updates and improvements will be made to enhance the user experience and expand the game's features.
